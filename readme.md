# ViteJS & Tailwind theme starter WP

This repo is a WordPress starter theme that uses ViteJS and TailwindCSS. Huge thanks to [St√©fan Lancelot](https://github.com/stfnlnc) for helping me setting up the theme.

## How to use the theme

### 1. Clone the repository into the theme folder of your WordPress installation:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:pommito/wp-theme-starter.git
   ```

### 2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd wp-theme-starter
   npm install
   ```

### 3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

***FYI** : For the theme to work in dev mode, make sure to set WP_DEBUG to true in wp-config.php.*

If your using, Local by Flywheel for local development, you'll need to switch the router mode to "localhost" in the Local settings, otherwise you could have CORS issues using the theme.
